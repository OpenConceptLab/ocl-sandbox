    "Completing the mappings of diagnoses and clinical findings to SNOMED CT and ICD-10 was relatively easier. Andrew was able to leverage some professional connections to obtain curated data, which significantly improved the accuracy of mappings between CIEL concepts and these terminologies. In return, we committed to delivering mappings to ICD-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ICD-11 is relatively recent — not necessarily in its creation, but in its implementation — and is much more complex than ICD-10 due to its use of extension codes, pre-coordinated, and post-coordinated concepts, the mapping posed additional challenges. It is important to note that CIEL is based exclusively on pre-coordinated concepts. Thus, we began the ambitious task of mapping the remaining **27,796 CIEL diagnosis concepts** to ICD-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, manual mapping efforts were extremely time-consuming. Before the initiation of this project, it could take up to **5 minutes** to manually map 3 CIEL concepts using a labor-intensive approach of copying, pasting, and searching for references across multiple tabs. Based on this method, a skilled individual could theoretically map the remaining concepts in approximately **193 days** (considering 1.67 minutes per mapping and 4 working hours per day)."

    "## Phase 1: Leveraging Existing Resources and Developing Support Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, there was a parallel effort by the OCL [(Open Concept Lab)](https://app.openconceptlab.org/) community to develop a mapping support tool, known as the **Mapping Tool**. This tool aimed to assist the mapping process across various terminologies, combining the power of large language models (LLMs) and ElasticSearch to suggest likely target concepts for a given source concept. Although the Mapping Tool was not a production-grade tool, we were able to take advantage of its development to create an initial triage table with approximately **1,693 ICD-11 code suggestions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Mapping Tool provided only **code suggestions** — and not the **mapping relationship type** (such as *NARROWER-THAN* or *BROADER-THAN*) — it operated under the assumption of *SAME-AS*, which was often not accurate. Therefore, it was necessary to curate these data points further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We imported these suggestions into a web service that was already deployed to support CIEL improvement processes, known as **CIEL Lab**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ICD-11 mapping, the **CIEL Lab** became a large working table where each row represented a CIEL concept. Concepts were either sourced from the Mapping Tool or added manually. The table allowed users to correct a suggested code, provide a missing code, and define the mapping type as *SAME-AS*, *NARROWER-THAN*, or *BROADER-THAN*.\n",

    "You just need to enter in your vscode, press `Cmd + Shift + P`, search and select `Open Workspace in Container`\n",

    "## Phase 3. Working with Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "ICD-11 uses extensions (prefixed with 'X' and connected by '&') to specify aspects such as severity, laterality, and body location, enhancing the precision of medical concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ICD-11, a stem code represents a pre-coordinated term, which refers to a clinical concept that has been fully assembled with its meaning encapsulated in a single code, such as \"Pneumonia\" or \"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\" Pre-coordination means that the complexity of the concept is built into the stem itself. However, when further granularity is needed — for example, indicating \"Left lung pneumonia\" instead of just \"Pneumonia\" — extensions are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions are linked to stem codes through an ampersand (’&’) and typically begin with the letter ‘X’. They allow post-coordination, meaning that users can combine a stem code with one or more extensions to provide richer, more specific clinical descriptions. For instance, a code for \"Pneumonia\" could be combined with an extension for \"Left lung\" to denote precisely the affected site.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Process:**\n",
    "- Structure and join ICD-10/11 tables clearly.\n",
    "- Vectorize data using ChromaDB.\n",
    "- Integrate vectors into LangChain.\n",
    "- Utilize a lightweight LLM (e.g., Mistral Small) to query semantic vectors.\n",
    "- Deploy an interactive webpage for easy validation, linking suggestions directly to the ICD-11 Browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured process enhances efficiency and accuracy in ICD-11 code mapping."
